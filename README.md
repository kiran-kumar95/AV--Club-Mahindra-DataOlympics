# AV--Club-Mahindra-DataOlympics :house:

Participated in 3 day challenge conducted by Analytics Vidhya. This repo contains the code for my solution for this competition.

## Problem Statement:
To predict the average amount spent on Food & Beverages per room night by a member in Club Mahindra Resorts

Club Mahindra (Club M) makes significant revenue from Food and Beverages (F&B) sales in their resorts. The members of Club M are offered a wide variety of items in either **buffet** or **Ã€ la carte** form. Following are some benefits that the model to predict the spend by a member in their next visit to a resort will bring:

1. Predicting the F&B spend of a member in a resort would help in improving the pre-sales during resort booking through web and mobile app
2. Targeted campaigns to suit the member taste and preference of F&B
3. Providing members in the resort with a customized experience and offers
4. Help resort kitchen to plan the inventory and food quantity to be prepared in advance
